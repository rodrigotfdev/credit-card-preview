## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to: 

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page



### Expected behaviour

- Update the details on the card as the user fills in the fields
- Validate the form fields when the form is submitted
- If there are no errors, display the completed state
- Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state
